## Data Storage

### Staff Data

The staff data is stored in a CSV file named `staff-id-to-team-mapping-long.csv` that maps staff IDs to their respective teams.

**Example:**

```
staff_pass_id,team_name,created_at
BOSS_6FDFMJGFV6YM,GRYFFINDOR,1620761965320
MANAGER_P49NK2CS3B5G,GRYFFINDOR,1614784710249
MANAGER_SEK8LLK8R8JL,HUFFLEPUFF,1618869819036
```

### Redemption Data

The redemption records are stored in a JSON file named `redemptions.json`. Each redemption entry contains the following fields:

- `teamName`: The name of the team that redeemed a gift.
- `redeemedAt`: The timestamp (in epoch milliseconds) of when the gift was redeemed.
- `redeemedBy`: The staff ID of the person who redeemed the gift.

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "teamName": "GRYFFINDOR",
    "redeemedAt": 1700000000000,
    "redeemedBy": "BOSS_6FDFMJGFV6YM"
  },
  {
    "teamName": "HUFFLEPUFF",
    "redeemedAt": 1700005000000,
    "redeemedBy": "MANAGER_SEK8LLK8R8JL"
  }
]
```

## Running Tests

- To run all tests, navigate to the root directory of the application and execute the following command:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Assumptions

- **Staff Eligibility**: Only members of the team can perform the gift redemption on behalf of the entire team.
- **Redemption Eligibility**: Each team is allowed to redeem the gift only once.
